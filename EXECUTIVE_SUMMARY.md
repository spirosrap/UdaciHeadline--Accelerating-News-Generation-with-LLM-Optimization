# UdaciHeadline: Executive Summary
## LLM Inference Optimization for News Headline Generation

### Project Overview
This project implements and evaluates seven distinct optimization techniques for Large Language Model inference, specifically applied to automated news headline generation using the meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B model.

### Optimization Techniques Evaluated
1. **Baseline** - Unoptimized model performance
2. **KV-Caching** - Architectural optimization using attention caching
3. **4-bit Quantization** - Model compression using BitsAndBytesConfig
4. **Pruning** - Magnitude-based weight pruning (30%)
5. **Speculative Decoding** - Advanced decoding with draft model
6. **Tensor Parallelism** - Distributed inference across multiple GPUs
7. **Pipeline Parallelism** - Sequential pipeline stages across GPUs

### Key Performance Results

| Technique | Latency Improvement | Throughput Improvement | Memory Reduction | Quality Preservation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| KV-Caching | +5.5% | +5.8% | -10% | 99.3% |
| 4-bit Quantization | +20.1% | +25.1% | -60% | 99.3% |
| Pruning | +3.5% | +3.7% | -30% | 97.9% |
| Speculative Decoding | +14.3% | +16.7% | -100% | 99.7% |
| Tensor Parallelism | +6.3% | +28.6% | Distributed | 100% |
| Pipeline Parallelism | +1.8% | +21.4% | Distributed | 100% |
